### 🎯 Overview
**Ghost Pursuit** is a 2D pixel-art action game where the player fights through four stages filled with ghosts and traps to reach the victory trophy.  
It represents my **second major coding milestone**, created shortly after my first *Breakout* prototype.  

This project introduced me to:
- Object-oriented programming in Python  
- Tile-based maps and scrolling cameras  
- Game-loop structure, animation frames, and collision logic  
- Audio and resource management inside Pyxel  
- Code organization and scalability for larger projects  

---

### 🧠 Game Concept
Your goal is to eliminate **25 ghosts** and find the **victory trophy** hidden in the map.

Each stage introduces new environments and challenges:
1. **Brown Zone** – the starting area  
2. **Blue Zone** – vertical exploration  
3. **Red Zone** – high-difficulty traps  
4. **Yellow Zone** – the final level

### 🕹️ Controls
| Action | Key |
|--------|-----|
| Move left | **Q** |
| Move right | **D** |
| Jump | **Space** |
| Reload | **R** |
| Toggle music | **M** |
| Shoot | **Left Mouse Button** |
| Start game | **G** |

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Game Engine:** [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)  
- **Graphics & Audio:** Custom `res.pyxres` resource bank  
- **Paradigm:** Object-oriented programming  
- **Core Systems:** Player class, gunshot class, ghost AI, collision detection, HUD, camera scrolling, and sound system  

---

### 💡 What I Learned
- How to design **modular classes** for player, enemies, and environment  
- Managing **state machines** (game start / running / win / lose)  
- Using **collision maps** and tile detection  
- Balancing gameplay variables (speed, gravity, health)  
- Integrating sound and visual feedback for player hits  
- Creating a full **project loop** from concept → prototype → polish

### 🌱 How It Connects to My Current Goals
This project marks a turning point between **experimentation** and **structured development**.  
It showed me how to apply engineering principles — modularity, readability, and testing — to creative work.  
The lessons from *Ghost Pursuit* directly inform my current focus on:
- Building **AI-enhanced interactive applications**  
- Combining **creativity and logic** through software design  
- Writing clean, maintainable codebases that scale
