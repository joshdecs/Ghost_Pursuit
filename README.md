GOAL:
Your goal is to kill the 25 ghosts, then find the victory trophy, jump on it to win.
The map has four stages:
    1) brown
    2) blue
    3) red
    4) yellow

Be careful ! There might be some traps...
There are some bricks through which you can pass and it's up to you to find them !

You have 25 health points, it probably seems to be a lot but you will see it's easy to loose them.
Don't forget to fill your munitions (KEY R) once you don't have anymore.

Good luck !
